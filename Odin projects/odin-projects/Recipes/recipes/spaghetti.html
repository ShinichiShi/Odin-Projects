        <img src="spaghetti.jpg">
       <p> Spaghetti is a long, thin, solid, cylindrical pasta.It is a staple food of traditional Italian cuisine. Like other pasta, spaghetti is made of milled wheat, water, and sometimes enriched with vitamins and minerals. Italian spaghetti is typically made from durum-wheat semolina. Usually the pasta is white because refined flour is used, but whole wheat flour may be added. Spaghettoni is a thicker form of spaghetti, while spaghettini is a thinner form. Capellini is a very thin spaghetti, sometimes known colloquially as "angel hair pasta", while Vermicelli refers to intermediate widths, varying between the United States and Italy. 
        Spaghetti is made from ground grain (flour) and water.Whole-wheat and multigrain spaghetti are also available.  </p>
